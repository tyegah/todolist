# ToDoList iOS App

## ToDoList App Feature Specs

This ToDoList app is created in Swift 5 and UIKit/SwiftUI for the UI presentation layer.
For the local database, it uses CoreData but the architecture of the app will allow the CoreData to be replaced by Realm or any other kind of database available for the iOS platform.
